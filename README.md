To create my visualization for my California Wildfire Analysis, I used a k-means clustering on wildfire latitude, longitude, and assessed property values 
(Assessed Improved Value (parcel)). The fires are separated into three geographic regions across California. The Southern and Central California region  
cluster is colored in red and located in the lower part of the state, the Northern Interior region cluster is colored in green and located in the central 
and upper inland area, and the Northern Coastal and Foothill Region is colored in blue and located along the coast. The clusters are formed based on the shape 
of California where the wildfires incidents tend to occur. There are also a few blue points that appear farther south, which is normal because k-means clustering 
groups fires based on all variables, so some individual fires match the coastal cluster even if they occur geographically lower on the map.

By looking at the point sizes, which represent the Assessed Improved Value (the dollar value of structures that were damaged), we can see that the Southern and 
Central regions experience most of the larger-loss events. This alludes to the fact that wildfires in this part of California tends to affect high-value 
properties/cause more severe damage. The Northern Interior region shows moderate losses, while the coastal and foothill region has smaller, less frequent high-value 
losses. Overall, the visualization helps highlight how wildfire impact varies by location and shows that the southern part of the state faces the greatest financial 
risk.
