### California Wildfires: Clustering & Financial Impact Analysis

## Motivation
For this project, I wanted to explore how California wildfires vary across different regions of the state and whether certain areas experience more severe financial losses than others. Wildfires have become increasingly destructive in recent years, and I was interested in understanding the geographic distribution of high-damage incidents. This led me to ask my big question. Are there natural clusters in where wildfires occur, and which regions of California face the greatest financial risk?

## Data Source
The data for this project comes from the CAL FIRE Post-Fire Master Dataset. This dataset records detailed information about wildfire incidents across California. It includes key variables such as location, structure category, damage level, and Assessed Improved Value (parcel). The dataset was originally downloaded from the CAL FIRE database and then imported into R for cleaning and analysis.

## Processing Steps
To prepare the dataset for clustering and visualization, I performed several cleaning and transformation steps in Excel and R. First, I removed columns in Excel that were not relevant to my analysis. This included fields that did not relate to location or property value. Then, I imported the cleaned dataset into R. After putting my dataset in R, I selected the key variables needed for clustering. These variables included Latitude, Longitude, and Assessed Improved Value. I removed rows with missing values using drop_na() to make sure the clustering algorithm only used complete data. I renamed certain columns for clarity and easier use in R like "Damage", "Incident Name", and "Assessed Improved Value." After that, I standardized the variables using scale() so that the k-means clustering would treat all features equally. Finally, these processing steps ensured that the clustering performed correctly and that my visualization was consistent and complete. 

## Visualization
The main visualization for this project is shown in the plot below. The visualization presents the results of k-means clustering which formed three geographic wildfire regions across California. Southern and Central California is colored in red, Northern Interior California is colored in green, and Northern Coastal & Foothill Region is colored in blue. The point size represents the Assessed Improved Value, in other words, the estimated dollar value of structures that were damaged. Larger points indicate fires that caused more costly damage. One thing we can notice are the couple blue points that appear farther south. This is normal because k-means groups fires by similarity across all variables, so some incidents align with the coastal cluster even when they occur geographically lower on the map.

## Analysis
The visualization shows that wildfires naturally cluster into three regions across California. The Southern & Central California cluster contains most of the largest-loss events, due to their larger point sizes. This suggests that wildfires in this region tend to affect higher-value properties or cause more severe damage. The Northern Interior region displays moderate losses, while the Northern Coastal and Foothill region shows smaller and less frequent high-loss fires. Overall, this analysis highlights how wildfire impact varies by location and suggests that the southern portion of the state faces the greatest financial risk. Clustering helps reveal these geographic and financial patterns, offering insight into how wildfire severity relates to regional development.
